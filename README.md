# Vue Weather App

John Komomarnicki - Vue and Taiwind - Weather App Build

## Description

Re-created a Vue weather search app. This app was written in Vue3 (including VueX and Vue-Router) and uses some revised logic and methods not shown during the project lectures.

### New features

Progress bar - easier to distinguish between low and high temperature.

Preprocessor for search query - precise search for adminstrative regions, according to designed display strategies, which is more consistent with search habits.

### Running

After downloading or cloning the repo, type `npm run dev` in the terminal to load the application locally on http://127.0.0.1:5173/.

### Note

Use domestic API to get more precise data（including administrative regions and local weather）. You will need to sign up for an API key at APISpace API (free for trial) and AMap API to use in config.js.

Search Language - Chinese only (not including Pinyin)  
Search scope - China
